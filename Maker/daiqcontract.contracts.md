Called either automatically after VOTE_PERIOD from the moment of proposal via "propose", via deferred action with proposer's auth, or (if deferred action fails) may be called directly by proposer after VOTE_PERIOD has passed. Proposal may be enacted if there are more votes in favor than against. Cleanup must be done regardless on relevant multi_index tables.
